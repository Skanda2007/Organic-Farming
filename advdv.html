                    <th>Advantages</th>
                    <th>Disadvantages</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>No Genetically modified organisms </b>- Some people are afraid of the idea of genetically modified seeds, but those who rely on organic farming for their crops don't have to worry about GMOs. These farms focus on preventing any interaction with outside organisms. Organic farming is a more natural way to grow food, so there is less risk of contamination, mutation or loss in crop yield.</td>
                    <td><b>Lack of subsidies</b> - Organic farming is without question a better choice than non-organic farming because of the lack of pesticides and GMOs. However, one big drawback is that organic farms are not subsidised by the government, so they have to rely on other methods such as charging higher prices to make up for their lack of income.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>Does not harm the soil</b> - Organic farmers use methods that can replace synthetic fertilisers and pesticides. They work with the soil to build healthy ecosystems and prevent erosion. Organic farmers also have a lower impact on the environment than their conventional counterparts, because they don't use chemicals that harm water quality or pollute the air.</td>
                    <td><b>Pesticides and other chemicals may still be used</b> - Organic farmers may use organic pesticides and other chemicals when necessary because the financial and monetary benefits outweigh health and environmental benefits (cause farmers may even lose their land if they do not make money off their crops)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>More nutritious food</b> - Farming practices that use organic methods make sure that the soil is fertile and fertilisers are not needed. These methods also produce nutrients like calcium, phosphorus, iron, and magnesium in a natural way. Organic farms can also make sure that the animals they raise are treated humanely because the farm will provide them with healthier food instead of using antibiotics to compensate for unhealthy food.</td>
                    <td><b>Not 100% organic</b> - Organic farming might not be truly organic. This can happen because of pesticides, herbicides and other chemicals that make their way into the soil. Moreover, farmers might be incentivised to use pesticides in order to prevent their crops from being destroyed by pests, because such a loss might result in a huge financial burden.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>Safer and healthier work environment</b> - Organic farming can provide a healthy working environment, which is something important when you're constantly surrounded by workers with health problems. Organic farmers have lower rates of pesticide exposure and use fewer harmful chemicals to maintain their land and crops.</td>
                    <td><b>Lack of support and infrastructure</b> - One of the prominent disadvantages of organic farming include the lack of infrastructure to support the industry and its many processes. It is also difficult for farmers to receive a profit from organic farming because it is too expensive to produce.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>Increased resistance to pests and disease</b> - Organic farms are resistant to pests, weeds, and diseases because they are typically kept without the use of pesticides, herbicides, and synthetic fertilisers. The increase in pest resistance also helps to reduce production costs for organic farmers.</td>
                    <td><b>Large initial investment</b> - Organic farming is an expensive business. To start an organic farm, it is recommended that a minimum investment of $50,000 be made. As the organic farmer makes more money, he or she can invest in new equipment for the farm. Organic farming can also be difficult because fertilisers, pesticides and other chemicals cannot be used to maintain the health or fend off pests from crops.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>Fertilisers are made naturally and on site</b> -  Organic fertilisers are made on site and use natural substances that help to enrich the crops without killing them. This type of farming is better for the earth, and it helps people who want to eat a healthier diet or make a bigger difference in the environment.</td>
                    <td><b>Organic farming is Knowledge-Intensive</b> - Organic farming is a knowledge-intensive process that has a variety of different strategies. For example, organic farmers have to independently monitor the amount of carbon dioxide and water in the atmosphere, soil moisture, acidity levels, and other environmental factors related to their farming methods. Farmers must also be aware of each plant�s natural life cycle as well as the soil�s needs. They must also comply with organic safety regulations if they want their milk and meat to sell to consumers.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>Can grow more variety of crops</b> - Organic farming can help farmers grow more variety in a shorter amount of time through methods such as crop rotation, composting, and animal breeding to make the land more productive without using any artificial fertilisers or pesticides.</td>
                    <td><b>Organic farming requires more work than conventional farming</b> - This means that organic farms need to employ a workforce that is well-versed with various organic farming practices. This also means increased costs and lower profit margins. Organic farms are also not as productive as non-organic farms; they often produce less than a third of what a farmer could by conventional means.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>Climate-friendly and easier on the environment</b> - Organic farming reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 25% and saves the water required to farm organic crops. Organic farms can be cultivated in a far more diverse range of eco-friendly ways, which creates a better balance between the native ecosystem, livestock and plants.</td>
                    <td><b>Complex paperwork and documentation</b> - Organic farming has less pesticides and no GMOs, but it does have its disadvantages. One of the biggest concerns is that organic farming has a tedious certification process, which can take up to six months or more and a considerable initial investment. For organic farmers in developing countries, this is a problem because the market for organic produce doesn�t exist yet.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>Sustainable</b> - In contrast to conventional farming, organic farming is more sustainable for the future because it�s more environmentally friendly and less destructive to the land. Organic farmers use sustainable agricultural practices such as maintaining crop rotation, using livestock to convert weeds into nutrient-rich soil and cover crops, and minimising chemical usage</td>
                    <td><b>Requires considerable efforts in marketing</b> - The biggest disadvantage is the lack of marketing for organic produce which makes it difficult to compete with conventional crops and less profitable in terms of revenue.</td>
